# On start:

1. Initialize git mono repository in root folder (for the set of services) if it's not initialized yet
2. Create .gitignore and ignore everything except source code
3. Using github-mcp create private repository in github and connect in to this project

# Always:

1. Work in develop branch as default
2. Don't commit or push anything if user doesn't ask for it
3. Check that gitignore file has enough masks

# On each task when user said to push 

4. Commit and push it to "develop" branch and create a Pull request to main branch
5. Return link to the pull request to the user
